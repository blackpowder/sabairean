<h1> Create the APK File </h1>
<p> 
    If you want to give someone your application to try out, you can just give them the copy of the .apk file in the bin directory
    of the project file hierarchy. To do this, you need to sign the application by using a self-signed certificate.
</p>

<p>
   Notice that, it is not the same as deploying, but it is the procedure of exporting. 
</p>

<p>
   In this example, we use the TestActivity project, but you can use any application. The step for exporting is shown as followed: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Right click on your project and select export </li>
    <li> Choose Android </li>
    <li> Choose Export Android Application </li>
    <div class="image">
      <img src="{{scope_image('export_android_application.png')}}" />
    </div>
    <li> If your application don't have any error, the window below will appear </li>
    <div class="image">
      <img src="{{scope_image('project_check.png')}}" /> 
    </div>
    <li> Next you will select the keystore, the keystore is the file holding your key </li>
    <li> Choose the location where you want to store your key and fill the password </li>
    <div class="image">
      <img src="{{scope_image('key_store.png')}}" />
    </div>
    <li> Now it is step to create the self-signed certificate </li>
    <div class="image">
      <img src="{{scope_image('/self_signed_certificate.png')}}" />
    </div>
    <li> Filled the required informations </li>
    <li> Click Finish </li>
</ul>

<p> 
    Now you have the .apk file, you can copy this file to the android device and click to install. There are several tools that you can browse 
    to find where your .apk file locate such as file manager.
