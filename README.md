###Sabairean - Learn to program in your own language

Sabairean is an initiative that was launched during the [GFN
challenge](http://www.gfnchallenge.org) in Cambodia in April 2013. The
goal is to provide technical learning resources to people in their
native language to help foster development communities in developing
countries.

The first use case we are focusing on is android development in Cambodia
