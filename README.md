#Sabairean - Learn to program in your own language

Sabairean is an initiative that was launched during the [GFN
challenge](http://www.gfnchallenge.org) in Cambodia in April 2013. The
goal is to provide technical learning resources to people in their
native language to help foster development communities in developing
countries.
