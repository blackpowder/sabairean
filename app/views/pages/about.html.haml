  %h2 Purpose
  %p.purpose
    Train people in developing countries to build mobile apps and participate in the digital revolution that is sweeping the planet.

  /Train a generation of programmers to  change the lives of the worlds poorest people

  %p
    In the next decade hundreds of millions of people who have had limited access to technology will use
    a computer for the first time. This computer will be a smart phone or tablet that they probably share
    with others and cost less than $100. It will have the power to change their lives.

  %p
    During the last 20 years mobile phones have had a profound effect in developing countries. Usage has grown
    at an exponential rate and at the end of 2011 there were 6 billion mobile subscriptions world wide with
    5 billion of those in developing countries. More people have access to cell phones than toilets.

  %blockquote
    "Mobile communications offer major opportunities to advance human and economic development â€“ from providing basic access to health information to making cash payments, spurring job creation, and stimulating citizen involvement in democratic processes"

  %p
    Impressive as these impacts have been it is nothing compared to the changes that will happen as the whole world
    gets access to computers with millions of apps a few taps away.

  %p
    Take a step back and think about the impact computers have had in developed countries over the last 30 years.
    They have changed everything - media, entertainment, politics, science, education as well as every single
    business and industry you can think of.  It isn't called the information revolution for nothing and for the vast
    majority of people on the planet it is only just beginning.

  %p
    But there is a problem. Many countries do not have enough people in a position to take advantage of this opportunity. Their IT
    communities are under trained, under paid and their formal education systems are often not up to scratch.

  %p
    That's what we want to help fix - Sabairean is a collective of developers from around the world committed to providing programmers
    everywhere access to free, world class education in their native language. We help people learn the skills to participate
    in one of the biggest opportunities of our time.

  %h2 History

  %p
    In April 2013 a group of entrepreneurs, designers and programmers from New Zealand formed the
    %a{href:'http://gfnchallenge.org/'}GFN Challenge
    and went to Cambodia for a week to volunteer on projects for local charities. One of these projects was
    %a{href:'http://www.gritlearning.com/'}Grit Learning
    who are doing fantastic work getting tablets into schools and using educational apps to revolutionize education.

  %p
    But Grit (and their local partner
    %a{href: 'http://www.kapekh.org/'}KAPE
    ) had a problem - all their educational apps were in english and it was difficult finding local developers who could
    translate existing apps, let alone build new ones. So the idea for Sabairean was formed - maybe we could do something
    to help older students learn how to build mobile apps and they could build help build educational apps for the
    younger ones.

  %p
    Our core idea was to create Khmer learning materials in an e-leaning platform and use informal programming clubs as
    a way students could learn how to build mobile apps.
    Together with a cambodian developer from
    %a{href:'http://instedd.org'}INSTEDD
    we built a prototype and trialled it in two schools. The results were positive enough that two
    %a{href: 'http://www.enspiral.com'} Enspiral
    developers returned to Cambodia in July 2013 to continue working on the project.

  %p
    We switched our focus to tertiary level students who often have some basic programming experience but not enough to
    confidently build their own apps. Students typically have quite good english but it is much easier to learn complex
    concepts in their native language and they have a strong preference for learning materials in Khmer. We are now beginning
    our first trials in August 2013 and the journey continues...

  %h2 What we are doing

  %h3 Localised creative commons learning materials
  %p
    We help experienced programmers and teachers create free programming learning materials which are translated into multiple languages.
    Each course is published on github under the creative commons license and free for anyone to use.

  %h3 Open source e-learning platform
  %p
    Our open source platform aggregates these courses and provides an easy to use portal for students to
    %ul
      %li Work through materials in their own time
      %li Help other people with their learning
      %li Build reputation and connect with other programmers

  %h3 Programming clubs
  %p
    Learning solely online is a good start but nothing beats in person interaction so a big part of Sabairean are the informal
    programming clubs.

  %h3 Commercial opportunities
  %p
    Programming clubs are a great start but to really become a strong programmer you need to find work that nurtures your
    growth. So a big focus for Sabairean is to help programmers find work which
    %strong pays well
    and
    %strong supports their learning.

  %p
    Our hope is that this will lead to strong international partnerships between people and companies who can work together to
    build applications that make a significant impact on human and economic development around the world.
