  %h2 Purpose
  %p.purpose
    Help people every access

  /Train a generation of programmers to  change the lives of the worlds poorest people

  %p
    In the next decade hundreds of millions of people who have had limited access to technology will use
    a computer for the first time. This computer will be a smart phone or tablet that they probably share
    with other people and cost less than $100. It will have the power to change their lives.

  %p
    During the last 20 years mobile phones have had a profound effect in developing countries. Usage has grown
    at an exponential rate and at the end of 2011 there were 6 billion mobile subscriptions world wide with
    5 billion of those in developing countries. More people have access to cell phones than toilets.

  %blockquote
    "Mobile communications offer major opportunities to advance human and economic development â€“ from providing basic access to health information to making cash payments, spurring job creation, and stimulating citizen involvement in democratic processes"

  %p
    Impressive as these impacts have been it is nothing compared to the changes that will happen as the whole world
    gets access to computers with millions of apps a few taps away.

  %p
    Take a step back and think about the impact computers have had in developed countries over the last 30 years.
    They have changed everything - media, entertainment, politics, science, education as well as every single
    business and industry you can think of.  It isn't called the information revolution for nothing and for the vast
    majority of people on the planet it is only just beginning.

  %p
    But there is a problem. Many countries do not have enough people in a position to take advantage of this opportunity. Their IT
    communities are under trained, under paid and their formal education systems are often not up to scratch.

  %p
    That's where we come in - Sabairean is a collective of developers from around the world committed to providing programmers
    everywhere access to free, world class education in their native language. We help people learn the skills to participate
    in one of the biggest opportunities of our time.


  %h2 History

  %p
    In April 2013 a group of entrepreneurs, designers and programmers from New Zealand formed the
    %a{href:'http://gfnchallenge.org/'}GFN Challenge
    and went to Cambodia for a week to volunteer on projects for local charities. One of these projects was
    %a{href:'http://www.gritlearning.com/'}Grit Learning
    who are doing fantastic work getting tablets into schools and using educational apps to revolutionize education.

  %p
    But Grit (and their local partner
    %a{href: 'http://www.kapekh.org/'}KAPE
    ) had a problem - all their educational apps were in english and it was difficult finding local developers who could
    translate existing apps, let alone build new ones. So the idea for Sabairean was formed - maybe we could
