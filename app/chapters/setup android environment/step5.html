        <h1> The Android Developer Tools (ADT) Plug-in for Eclipse</h1>
        <p>
            Now that you have the SDK files installed, along with Eclipse and the JDK, there is one
more critical part to install: the Android Developer Tools (ADT) plug-in. The ADT
plug-in adds Android-specific functionality to Eclipse.
        </p>
        <p>
           Software in the plug-in enables Eclipse to: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Build Android Application. </li>
            <li> Launch the Android emulator. </li>
            <li> Connect to debugging service on the emulator. </li>
            <li> Edit Android XML Files. </li>
            <li> edit and compile Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL) files. </li>
            <li> create Android application packages (.apk files). </li>
            <li> perform other Android-specific tasks. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3> Using the Install New Software Wizard to download and install the ADT Plug-in </h3>
        <p>
           Start the Install New Software Wizard by selecting Help -> Install New Software. To install the ADT plug-in, type this URL into the “Work with” field and
press Return or Enter: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/
            <br/>
            <img src="images/Install ADT Plugin.png" />
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Once you have added the URL to the list of sites for acquiring new plug-ins, you will
see an entry called Developer Tools listed in the Available Software list.
            <br/>
            <img src="images/availble software.png" />
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Select the Developer Tools item by clicking on the checkbox next to it, and click on
the Next button. The next screen will ask you to accept the license for this software.
After you accept and click Finish, the ADT will be installed. You will have to restart
Eclipse to complete the installation.
