        <h1>Adding Build Targets to the SDK</h1>
        <p>
            Before you can build an Android application, or even create a project that would try to
build an Android application, you must install one or more build targets. To do this,
you will use the SDK and AVD Manager. This tool enables you to install packages in
the SDK that will support multiple versions of the Android OS and multiple API levels.
        </p>
        
        <p>
           Once the ADT plug-in is installed in Eclipse, which we describe in the next section, the
SDK and AVD Manager can be invoked from within Eclipse. It can also be invoked from the command line, 
which is how we will do it here. To invoke the SDK and AVD
Manager from the command line, issue this command: <div class="command"> android </div> 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This is the SDK and AVD Manager, with all the available SDK versions for installation.

        <p>
            The packages labeled “SDK Platform” support building applications compatible with
different Android API levels. You should install, at a minimum, the most recent (highest-
numbered) version, but installing all the available API levels, and all the Google API
add-on packages, is a good choice if you might someday want to build applications
that run on older Android versions. You should also install, at a minimum, the most
recent versions of the example applications package. You must also install the Android
SDK Platform-Tools package.
