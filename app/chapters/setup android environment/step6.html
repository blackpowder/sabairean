        <h1> Configure the ADT plug-in </h1>
        <p>
            One more step, and you are done installing. Once you have installed the ADT plug-in,
you will need to configure it. Installing the plug-in means that various parts of Eclipse
now contain Android software development-specific dialogs, menu commands, and
other tools, including the dialog you will now use to configure the ADT plug-in.
        </p>
        <p>
            The step to configure the ADT plug-in is as followed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> In eclipe, select Window -> Preference (Linux and Windows) or Eclipse -> Preference (Mac) </li>
            <li> Click the item labeled Android in the left panel of the Preference dialog. </li>
            <li> Enter the path where you put the SDK </li>
            <li> Click Apply </li>
            <li> Your Android SDK installation is now completed. </li>
        </ul>
