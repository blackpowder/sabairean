            The Android SDK
        </h1>
        
        <p>
            With the JDK and Eclipse installed, you have the prerequisites for the Android SDK,
and are ready to install the SDK. The Android SDK is a collection of files: libraries,
executables, scripts, documentation, and tools. Installing the SDK means downloading
the correct version of the SDK for your platform and putting the SDK files into a folder
in your home directory. There is no installation script. Later, you will configure an
Eclipse plug-in so it can find where you put the SDK. The appearance, requirements,
and functionality of the Android toolkit are changing very rapidly. The following outlined
process is a guideline that may not exactly reflect your experience. The most recent
documentation can always be found at <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/index.html">http://developer.android.com/tools/index.html</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To install the SDK, download the SDK package that corresponds to your system from 
            <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The SDK contains one or two folders for tools: one named tools and, starting in version
8 of the SDK, another called platform-tools. These folders need to be on your path,
which is a list of folders your system searches for executable files when you invoke an
executable from the command line.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Configure SDK path on Macintosh and Linux system
        </h3>
        <p>
            In order to configure SDK path, the PATH environment variable should be done in:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    .profile (Ubuntu)
                </li>
                <li>
                    .bash_profile (Mac OS X)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Add a line to that file that sets the PATH environment variable
to include the tools directory in the SDK (individual entries in the list are separated by
colons). For example, you could use the following line (but replace both instances of
~/android-sdk-ARCH with the full path to your Android SDK install):
        <div class="command">
            export PATH=$PATH:~/android-sdk-ARCH/tools:~/android-sdk-ARCH/platform-tools
        </div>
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Configure SDK path on Window
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Start -> right-Click Computer</li>
            <li> Properties </li>
            <li> Advance system setting </li>
            <li> Environment Variable </li>
            <li> Double click the path system variable </li>
            <li> Add path to the folders by going to the end of this variable's value </li>
            <li> Adding the two paths to the end, separated by semicolons with no space before them Example: <i>;C:\android-sdk-windows\tools;C:\android-sdk-windows\platform-tools</i></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            After youâ€™ve edited your path on Windows, Mac, or Linux, close and reopen any Command Prompts or Terminals
        </p>
