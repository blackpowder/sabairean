            The Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
        </h1>
        <p>
            Eclipse is usually used as an IDE for writing, testing, and debugging software, especially
            Java software. There are also several derivative IDEs and SDKs for various kinds of Java
            software development based on Eclipse. In this case, you will take a widely used Eclipse
            package and add a plug-in to it to make it usable for Android software development.
            Let’s get that Eclipse package and install it.
        </p>

        <p>
           Eclipse can be downloaded from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads
        </p>

        <p>
            The System Requirements article on the
Android Developers site lists three choices of Eclipse packages as a basis for an Eclipse
installation for Android software development:
            <ul>
                <li>Eclipse Classic (for Eclipse 3.5 or later)</li>
                <li>Eclipse IDE for JAVA developers</li>
                <li>Eclipse for RCP/Plug-in Developers</li>
            </ul>
            Any of these will work, though unless you are also developing Eclipse plug-ins, choosing
either Classic or the Java Developers package (EE or Standard) makes the most
sense.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Eclipse download site will automatically determine the available system-specific
downloads for your system, though you may have to choose between 32 and 64 bits to
match your operating system. The file you download is an archive. To install Eclipse,
open the archive and copy the eclipse folder to your home folder. The executable file
for launching Eclipse on your system will be found in the folder you just extracted from
the archive.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you are using Ubuntu or another Linux distribution, you should not install Eclipse
from your distribution’s repositories, and if it is currently installed this way, you must
remove it and install Eclipse as described here. The presence of an “eclipse” package
in the Ubuntu repositories is an inheritance from the Debian repositories on which
Ubuntu is based. It is not a widely used approach to installing and using Eclipse, because
most of the time, your distribution’s repositories will have older versions of
Eclipse.
        </p>

            To confirm that Eclipse is correctly installed and that you have a JRE that supports
Eclipse, launch the executable file in the Eclipse folder. You may want to make a shortcut
to this executable file to launch Eclipse more conveniently. You should see the
Welcome screen as follows:
            <br/>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="../image/eclipse_welcome.png"/>
            </div>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Eclipse is implemented in Java and requires a JRE. The JDK you previously installed
provides a JRE. If Eclipse does not run, you should check that the JDK is correctly
installed.
