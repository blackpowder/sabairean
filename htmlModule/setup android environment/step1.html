            Installing the Android SDK and Prerequisites
        </h1>
        <p>
            Successfully installing the Android SDK requires two other software systems that are
            not part of the Android SDK: the Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Eclipse integrated
            development environment (IDE).
        </p>
        
        <h2>
            The Java Development Kit(JDK)
        </h2>
        <p>
            If your system has an up-to-date JDK installed, you wonâ€™t need to install it again. The
            JDK provides tools, such as the Java compiler, used by IDEs and SDKs for developing
            Java programs. The JDK also contains a Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which enables
            Java programs, such as Eclipse, to run on your system.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Install JDK for Window
        </h3>
        <p>
            You need to download the JDK from this site <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>
            <br/>
            Once you have the executable file, run it to install the JDK.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Install JDK for Linux
        </h3>
        <p>
            For Linux user, you need to perform the following step:
            <br/>
            Download the archive or package corresponding to your system.
            <br/>
            Extract the archive by typing:
            <br/>
            <span class="command"> (tar -xvf archive-name.tar.gz) </span>
            <br/>
            The JDK archive will be extracted into the ./jdk-name directory. Now move the JDK directoy to /usr/lib 
            <br/>
            <span class="command"> (sudo mv ./jdk-name /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-name) </span>
            <br/>
            Moving the JDK to that location makes it a configurable alternative in your Linux
            environment, which is useful if you have projects or programs that require other versions
            of the JRE or JDK. Now run:
            <br/>
            <span class="command">
                sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" \ "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-name/bin/java" 1
            </span>
            <br/>
            <span class="command">
                sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" \ "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-name.0/bin/javac" 1
            </span>
            <br/>
            <span class="command">
                sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javaws" "javaws" \ "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-name/bin/javaws" 1
            </span>
            <br/>
            <span class="command">
                sudo update-alternatives --config java
            </span>
            <br/>
            You will see output similar to that shown here:
            <div class="image">
            <img src="../image/java_choice.png"/>
            </div>
            When you select the JDK you are installing, you will see the output like this:
            <div class="image">
            <img src="../image/after_select_jdk.png"/>
            </div>
            Repeat the preceding selection process for javac:
            <br/>
            <span class="command">
               sudo update-alternatives --config javac
            </span>
            <br/>
            And for javaws:
            <br/>
            <span class="command">
               sudo update-alternatives --config javaws 
            </span>
        </p>
    </body>
